# User Complaints - October

## Continuing Issues from September
The bugs from last month (user-complaints-sept.md) are STILL not fixed:
- Dark mode toggle flickering
- Slow mobile performance
- Mobile crashes are now affecting more users

## New Complaints
- File search is too basic - can't search file content
- No AI features yet (users asking for this!)
- Export doesn't work for large vaults

## Support Tickets
- 45 tickets this month (up from 30 last month)
- Most common: mobile crashes (30%), UI bugs (25%), performance (20%)

## Urgent Action Needed
We're losing users to competitors. Need to prioritize bug fixes over new features. See sprint-retrospective-oct.md for action plan.
