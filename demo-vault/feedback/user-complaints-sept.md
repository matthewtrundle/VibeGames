# User Complaints - September

## UI Issues
- **Dark mode toggle is broken** - Users report flickering and ghost elements (now tracked in bug-report-haunted-ui.md)
- Dashboard loads slowly on mobile (3-5 seconds) - see performance-issues-log.md
- Search bar doesn't respond to keyboard shortcuts

## Feature Requests
- Export functionality for notes
- Better markdown preview
- Tags for organizing files
- AI-powered search (this would be HUGE!)

## Positive Notes
Users love the concept and the spooky theme! Just needs polish. Several users said "if the bugs were fixed, this would be a 5-star app."

## Quotes
> "Great idea, terrible execution"
> "The theme is fun but the app is too buggy to use daily"
> "Please fix the dark mode, I love this app!"
