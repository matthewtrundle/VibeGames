# Random Product Ideas

## AI-Powered Features
1. **Smart Search**: Natural language queries like "find notes about bugs from last month"
2. **Auto-Tagging**: AI reads files and suggests tags
3. **Note Connections**: AI finds related notes you didn't know were connected
4. **Summarization**: "Summarize all my meeting notes from this week"
5. **Question Answering**: Chat with your notes like a second brain

## Organization Features
- Folder templates for different note types
- Saved searches and filters
- Custom views (kanban, timeline, etc.)
- Note relationships graph

## Integration Ideas
- Obsidian plugin
- Notion import/export
- Google Drive sync
- Slack integration for sharing notes

## Monetization Ideas
- Free tier: 100 files
- Pro tier: Unlimited files + AI features
- Team tier: Collaboration + shared vaults
- Enterprise: Custom deployment

## Crazy Ideas (Probably Bad)
- Gamification: "Level up your note-taking!"
- NFT badges for power users (please no)
- Voice notes with AI transcription
- AR mode for viewing notes in 3D space (???)

Some of these are good, some are terrible. The AI features seem most promising though.
