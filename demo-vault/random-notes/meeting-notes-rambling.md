# Meeting Notes - Product Planning

*Warning: These are unstructured stream-of-consciousness notes*

## Attendees
- Me
- Sarah (design)
- Alex (eng)
- Jordan (product)

## Agenda
- Q4 roadmap
- Bug prioritization
- Feature requests

## Discussion

Sarah showed new dark mode designs - MUCH better contrast. Should fix the flickering issue (bug-report-haunted-ui.md).

Alex says mobile crashes (bug-report-mobile-crashes.md) are caused by memory leak. Will fix by end of week. THANK GOD.

Jordan presented survey results (survey-results-q3.md) - users REALLY want AI features. Like, 45% mentioned it. We should probably do that.

Discussed performance issues (performance-issues-log.md). Alex proposed:
- Lazy loading
- Virtual scrolling
- Cache optimization
Should see 50% improvement. Let's do it.

## Action Items
- Sarah: Finalize dark mode redesign
- Alex: Fix mobile crash bug + memory leak
- Jordan: Draft AI feature spec
- Me: Review user complaints (user-complaints-sept.md, user-complaints-oct.md) and prioritize

## Random Thoughts
- We're so close to product-market fit
- Users love the spooky theme - keep it!
- Need to hire more engineers
- Sprint retro on Friday (see sprint-retrospective-oct.md)

Need coffee. This meeting was productive but I'm exhausted.
