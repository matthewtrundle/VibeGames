# 3 AM Thoughts from the Crypt

Random ideas that haunt me at midnight:

## AI Ideas
- What if we add AI-powered tag suggestions based on file content?
- AI that reads ALL your notes and finds patterns you missed
- "Spirit medium" chat interface where you ask questions about your notes
- Auto-summarize long documents

## UI Fixes
- Dark mode performance optimization - investigate CSS paint times
- Need to fix that flickering bug ASAP (bug-report-haunted-ui.md)
- Mobile needs love - those crashes are killing us

## Marketing
- Halloween launch event? Spooky marketing campaign?
- Lean into the "Headless Horseman finding his head" metaphor
- Social media: share spooky note-taking tips

## Technical Debt
- Refactor file reading logic
- Add proper error handling
- Unit tests (we have like... 3 tests total ðŸ˜±)

Most of these are probably terrible. But the AI tag suggestion one... that could be something.

Also: SERIOUSLY need to fix that UI bug users keep mentioning. It's getting embarrassing (see user-complaints-sept.md and user-complaints-oct.md).
