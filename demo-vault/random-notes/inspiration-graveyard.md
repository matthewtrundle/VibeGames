# Inspiration Graveyard ðŸª¦

*Where good ideas come to rest (or die)*

## Ideas We Tried (and Failed)
### Light Mode
Turns out users HATE light mode for this app. They want maximum spooky darkness. RIP light mode, you tried.

### Gamification
"Earn points for taking notes!" - No. Just no. Users found it annoying. Back to the basics.

### Social Features
Share your notes with friends! Except... people don't want to share their random scattered thoughts. Privacy wins.

## Ideas We Haven't Tried Yet
### AI Chat
This keeps coming up in feedback (user-complaints-sept.md, random-product-ideas.md). Maybe it's time?

### Better Search
Current search is basic. Users want semantic search, content search, AI-powered search.

### Performance Fixes
Not sexy, but necessary. See performance-issues-log.md.

## Ideas That Might Work Someday
- Voice notes
- Collaboration features (but keep simple)
- API for developers
- Mobile app redesign
- Browser extension

## Ideas That Should Stay Dead
- Blockchain (why did we even consider this)
- Ads (would ruin the vibe)
- Required sign-in (current local-first is better)
- Removing spooky theme (NEVER)

## Lessons Learned
- Users want simple, fast, reliable
- Spooky theme is our differentiator
- Fix bugs before adding features
- Listen to user feedback (it's in feedback/ folder)

Sometimes the graveyard teaches us more than living ideas.
