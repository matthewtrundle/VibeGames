# Bug Report: Haunted UI Glitches

## Issue
The dashboard UI is experiencing ghostly glitches when switching between dark and light mode. Elements fade in/out unexpectedly, creating a truly haunted experience (but not the good kind).

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Load dashboard in dark mode
2. Toggle to light mode
3. Watch components flicker like restless spirits

## Impact
Users report confusion and eye strain. Multiple support tickets filed (see user-complaints-sept.md and user-complaints-oct.md).
