# Feature Request: Improved Dark Mode

## User Request
Multiple users have requested a better dark mode implementation. Current version has contrast issues and the mode switcher is buggy (see bug-report-haunted-ui.md).

## Proposed Solution
- Redesign color palette with better contrast ratios
- Fix the flickering toggle bug
- Add smooth transitions between modes
- Consider making dark mode the default (it's a spooky app after all!)

## User Quotes
From survey-results-q3.md:
> "Love the concept but the dark mode hurts my eyes"
> "Dark mode toggle doesn't work properly"

## Priority
High - affects UX for 80% of users who prefer dark mode
