# 🎃 Demo Vault - The Headless Horseman's Quest

This is a sample Obsidian vault for demonstrating **The Headless Horseman's Quest** - an AI-powered markdown aggregator.

## 📁 Structure

```
demo-vault/
├── product-logs/     # Bug reports, features, sprint notes (5 files)
├── feedback/         # User complaints, surveys, support tickets (5 files)
└── random-notes/     # Ideas, todos, meeting notes (5 files)
```

Total: **15 interconnected markdown files**

## 🔮 Try These AI Queries

Once you're in the Spirit Medium chat, try asking:

1. **"What bugs are mentioned in the product logs?"**
   - Should find 3-5 files about UI flickering, mobile crashes, performance

2. **"Summarize the user feedback"**
   - Should pull from multiple feedback files and provide coherent summary

3. **"What features are users requesting?"**
   - Should extract feature requests from various files

4. **"What did the sprint retrospective say about bugs?"**
   - Should read sprint-retrospective-oct.md and related bug files

5. **"What are the biggest problems right now?"**
   - Should identify mobile crashes, UI bugs, performance issues

## 📝 File Interconnections

These files reference each other to demonstrate AI's ability to connect information:

- Bug reports → reference user complaints
- Sprint retrospective → mentions multiple bug files
- Meeting notes → discusses survey results
- Random thoughts → mention fixing bugs
- Support tickets → link to specific bug reports

## 🎃 Spooky Theme

All files maintain the spooky Halloween theme while containing realistic product development content. Because when your notes are scattered across the digital graveyard, you need a spirit guide to reunite them!

## 🚀 Perfect for Demo

This vault is optimized for:
- Quick scanning (15 files loads fast)
- AI queries (interconnected content)
- Visual impact (spooky but professional)
- Realistic scenarios (actual product problems)

**May the Headless Horseman find his scattered thoughts!** 👻
