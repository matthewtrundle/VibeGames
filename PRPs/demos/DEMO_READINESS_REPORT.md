## 🎤 Demo Strategy

### Key Differentiator
**12 PARALLEL AI AGENTS** - This is the unique story!

The application was built using the `/hackathon-prp-parallel` workflow with 12 specialized AI agents working simultaneously:
- 4 agents for specifications (business, tech, UX, demo)
- 2 agents for backend implementation
- 2 agents for frontend components
- 2 agents for integration & testing
- 2 agents for documentation

**Total build time:** ~25 minutes from concept to working MVP

### Demo Flow (3 minutes)
1. **Opening Hook** (15s) - "Ever lost your head looking for information?"
2. **File Discovery** (45s) - Show search, filters, modal
3. **AI Spirit Medium** (90s) - 2-3 streaming queries
4. **Tech Highlights** (30s) - Stack, parallel agents, accessibility
5. **Closing** (15s) - Call to action, GitHub link

### Demo Queries (Primary)
1. "What bugs are mentioned?" - Establishes capability
2. "Summarize user feedback" - Main wow moment
3. "What features are users requesting?" - Action-oriented close

### Visual Wow Moments
- Real-time search filtering
- Smooth modal animations
- AI streaming responses
- Stats dashboard with animated progress bars
- Spooky hover effects
- Orange glow focus states
