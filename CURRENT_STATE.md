## Next Steps

Running full `/hackathon-prp-parallel PRPs/INITIAL.md` workflow to:
1. Generate comprehensive specs (4 agents)
2. Create implementation plans (2 agents)  
3. Build/enhance implementation (5 agents)
4. Integrate and prepare demo (1 agent)

Total: 12 parallel agents building the complete vision!
